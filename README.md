# Climate X Quantus

This repository contains the code and supplementary packages for the paper **["Finding the right XAI Method --- A Guide for the Evaluation and Ranking of Explainable AI Methods in Climate Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00652)**  by Bommer et. al.

![Python version](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Blue_Python_3.7_Shield_Badge.svg)


This code is currently under active development and will be continuously updated including further tutorials and version which will provide fully running 
experiment version. Further requirements such as preprocessed download are currently necessary to reproduce paper results.
